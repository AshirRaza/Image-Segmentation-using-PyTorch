# Image-Segmentation-using-PyTorch
This program is designed to perform human segmentation using a U-Net model implemented in PyTorch with the segmentation-models-pytorch library. It includes steps for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The code utilizes image augmentation techniques to enhance the diversity of the training data and improve the model's performance. The U-Net architecture is a popular choice for image segmentation tasks due to its effectiveness in capturing intricate details. The trained model can be used to predict pixel-wise human segmentation masks for input images. The program also provides visualization capabilities to display the original image, ground truth mask, and predicted mask side by side for evaluation and analysis.
